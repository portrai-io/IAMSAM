## Data organization rule for IAMSAM

To effectively utilize ST data for analysis in IAMSAM, it is important to organize the required files in a structured manner. Follow the guidelines below to organize the files within the `data` folder:

### 1. Create a Folder

Within `data` folder (Here!), create a folder named with desired `sample_name`. This name will display on IAMSAM dropdown menu.

### 2. Prepare Essential Files

Prepare the following five essential files, which are typically generated by the 10X Visium platform:

- `filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5`
- `spatial/tissue_positions_list.csv`
- `spatial/scalefactors_json.json`
- `spatial/tissue_lowres_image.png`
- `spatial/tissue_hires_image.png`

### 3. Organize Subfolders

Create a subfolder named `spatial` within the `sample_name` folder. 

Don't forget to place the files `tissue_positions_list.csv`, `scalefactors_json.json`, `tissue_lowres_image.png`, and `tissue_hires_image.png` within `spatial` subfolder.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your ST data is properly organized and ready for analysis in IAMSAM.
