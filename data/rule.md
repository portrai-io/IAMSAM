## Data organization rule for IAMSAM

To effectively use Spatial Transcriptomics data for analysis in IAMSAM, it is important to preprocess the data beforehand. Please follow the guidelines below to organize the files within the data folder:

1. Preprocess your .h5ad files using the provided Jupyter notebooks:

- For Visium data, refer to notebook/Preprocessing_visium.ipynb.
- For Xenium data, refer to notebook/Preprocessing_xenium.ipynb.

2. After preprocessing, place the resulting .h5ad files inside the data folder.
